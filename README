NAME

    Gentoo::App::Pram - Library to fetch a GitHub Pull Request as an
    am-like patch.

DESCRIPTION

    The purpose of this module is to fetch Pull Requests from GitHub's CDN
    as am-like patches in order to facilitate the merging and closing of
    Pull Requests. This module also takes care of adding "Closes:" and
    "Bug:" which are Gentoo-specific. See GLEP 0066.

FUNCTIONS

      * fetch_patch($patch_url)

      Fetch patch from $patch_url. Return patch as a string.

      * modify_patch($patch)

      Modify the patch headers. This function only modifies the headers of
      the first commit. Namely: * Add a "Closes: https://github.com/XXX"
      header. Check first if it wasn't added already. This header is parsed
      by the Github bot upon merge. The bot then automatically closes the
      pull request. See
      https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords for
      more info. * Add a "Bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/XXX" header when the
      `--bug XXX` option is given. This header is parsed by the Gentoo
      Bugzilla bot upon merge. The bot then writes a message in the bug
      report. See GLEP 0066 for more info. * Add a "Closes:
      https://bugs.gentoo.org/XXX" header when the `--closes XXX` option is
      given. This header is parsed by the Gentoo Bugzilla bot upon merge.
      The bot then automatically closes the bug report. See GLEP 0066 for
      more info.

      * apply_patch($editor, $git_command, $patch)

      Apply $patch onto HEAD of the current git repository using
      $git_command. This functions also shows $patch in $editor for a final
      review.
